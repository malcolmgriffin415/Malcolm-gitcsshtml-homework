# Malcolm's ReadME

This project is a webpage code project that shows that I understand how to group code in a logical way. This project shows a compilation of coding practices put together to show that I am grasping small things over time.

I grouped all code into a semantic style, then I made sure all headings were in order and also ensured everything was clear and concise in case they were to pick up the code randomly so that they could understand it
